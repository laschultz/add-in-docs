## Setting up Outlook add-ins for compose forms
<a name="mod_off15_CreatingForCompose_SettingUp"> </a>

Starting with version 1.1 of the schema for Office Add-ins manifests and v1.1 of office.js, you can create compose add-ins, which are Outlook add-ins activated in compose forms. In contrast with read add-ins (Outlook add-ins that are activated in read mode when a user is viewing a message or appointment), compose add-ins are available in the following user scenarios:


- Composing a new message, meeting request, or appointment in a compose form.
    
- Viewing or editing an existing appointment, or meeting item in which the user is the organizer.
    
     **Note**  If the user is on the RTM release of Outlook 2013 and Exchange 2013 and is viewing a meeting item organized by the user, the user can find read add-ins available. Starting in the Office 2013 SP1 release, there's a change such that in the same scenario, only compose add-ins can activate and be available.
- Composing an inline response message or replying to a message in a separate compose form.
    
- Editing a response ( **Accept**,  **Tentative**, or  **Decline**) to a meeting request or meeting item.
    
- Proposing a new time for a meeting item.
    
- Forwarding or replying to a meeting request or meeting item.
    
In each of these compose scenarios, any add-in command buttons defined by the add-in are shown. For older add-ins that do not implement add-in commands, users can choose  **Office Add-ins** in the ribbon to open the add-in selection pane, and then choose and start a compose add-in. Figure 1 shows add-in commands in a compose form.

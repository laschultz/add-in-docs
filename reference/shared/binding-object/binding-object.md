## Remarks

The  **Binding** object exposes the functionality possessed by all bindings regardless of type.

The  **Binding** object is never called directly. It is the abstract parent class of the objects that represent each type of binding:[MatrixBinding](../reference/shared/binding-object/matrixbinding-object/matrixbinding-object.md), [TableBinding](../reference/shared/binding-object/tablebinding-object/tablebinding-object.md), or [TextBinding](../reference/shared/binding-object/tablebinding-object/textbinding-object.md). All three of these objects inherit the  **getDataAsync** and **setDataAsync** methods from the **Binding** object that enable to you interact with the data in the binding. They also inherit the **id** and **type** properties for querying those property values. Additionally, the **MatrixBinding** and **TableBinding** objects expose additional methods for matrix- and table-specific features, such as counting the number of rows and columns.

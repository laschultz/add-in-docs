```
var rowCount = bindingObj.rowCount;
```


## Return Value

The number of rows in the specified [TableBinding](../reference/shared/binding-object/tablebinding-object/tablebinding-object.md) object.


## Remarks

When you insert an empty table by selecting a single row in Excel 2013 and Excel Online (using  **Table** on the **Insert** tab), both Office host applications create a single row of headers followed by a single blank row. However, if your add-in's script creates a binding for this newly inserted table (for example, by using the[addFromSelectionAsync](../reference/shared/bindings-object/addfromselectionasync-method.md) method), and then checks the value of the **rowCount** property, the value returned will differ depending whether the spreadsheet is open in Excel 2013 or Excel Online.


- In Excel on the desktop,  **rowCount** will return 0 (the blank row following the headers is not counted).
    
- In Excel Online,  **rowCount** will return 1 (the blank row following the headers is counted).
    
You can work around this difference in your script by checking if  `rowCount == 1`, and if so, then checking if the row contains all empty strings.

In content add-ins for Access, for performance reasons the  **rowCount** property always returns -1.


## Example




```
function showBindingRowCount() {
    Office.context.document.bindings.getByIdAsync("myBinding", function (asyncResult) {
        write("Rows: " + asyncResult.value.rowCount);
    });
}
// Function that writes to a div with id='message' on the page.
function write(message){
    document.getElementById('message').innerText += message; 
}
```

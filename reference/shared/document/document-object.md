## Remarks

You don't instantiate the  **Document** object directly in your script. To call members of the **Document** object to interact with the current document or worksheet, use `Office.context.document` in your script.


## Example

The following example uses the  **getSelectedDataAsync** method of the **Document** object to retrieve the user's current selection as text, and then display it in the add-in's page.


```

// Display the user's current selection.
function showSelection() {
    Office.context.document.getSelectedDataAsync(
        "text",                        // coercionType
        {valueFormat: "unformatted",   // valueFormat
        filterType: "all"},            // filterType
        function (result) {            // callback
            var dataValue; 
            dataValue = result.value;
            write('Selected data is: ' + dataValue);
        });
}
// Function that writes to a div with id='message' on the page.
function write(message){
    document.getElementById('message').innerText += message; 
}
```

## Remarks

Do not directly call or instantiate the  **ProjectDocument** object in your script.


## Example

The following example initializes the add-in and then gets properties of the [Document](../reference/shared/document/document-object.md) object that are available in the context of a Project document. A Project document is the opened, active project. To access members of the **ProjectDocument** object, use the **Office.context.document** object as shown in the code examples for **ProjectDocument** methods and events.

The example assumes your add-in has a reference to the jQuery library and that the following page control is defined in the content div in the page body:




```HTML
<span id="message"></span>
```




```
(function () {
    "use strict";

    // The initialize function must be run each time a new page is loaded.
    Office.initialize = function (reason) {
        $(document).ready(function () {

            // Get information about the document.
            showDocumentProperties();
        });
    };

    // Get the document mode and the URL of the active project.
    function showDocumentProperties() {
        var output = String.format(
            'The document mode is {0}.<br/>The URL of the active project is {1}.',
            Office.context.document.mode,
            Office.context.document.url);
        $('#message').html(output);
    }
})();
```
